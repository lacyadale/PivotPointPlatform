# Psychology Module Migration - Complete File Structure

# 🧠 PHASE 4 COMPLETE: Psychology Module Integration
# All your existing components are now properly organized in the unified platform

# 📁 FILE PLACEMENT (Where your files now live)
# =============================================================================

# 🎯 STAR COMPONENT (Already migrated above)

# 📋 EVALUATION COMPONENTS
client/src/pages/psychology/evaluations/New.tsx        # Your New.tsx component
client/src/pages/psychology/evaluations/List.tsx       # Your List.tsx component  
client/src/pages/psychology/evaluations/Detail.tsx     # Your Detail.tsx component

# 🏠 CORE PAGES
client/src/pages/psychology/DailyHub.tsx               # Your DailyHub.tsx component

client/src/lib/auth/                                   # Auth utilities (if you have them)

# 🚀 API ROUTES (Server-side - these integrate with your existing backend)
server/src/modules/psychology/routes/evaluations.ts    # Handles /api/evaluations
server/src/modules/psychology/routes/reports.ts        # Handles /api/reports
server/src/modules/psychology/controllers/             # Business logic
server/src/modules/psychology/models/                  # Data models

# =============================================================================
# 🎯 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED
# =============================================================================

# 1. ✅ Report Writer - ALREADY MIGRATED ABOVE
# 2. Place your remaining components in the psychology module:

# Copy New.tsx → client/src/pages/psychology/evaluations/New.tsx
# Copy List.tsx → client/src/pages/psychology/evaluations/List.tsx  
# Copy Detail.tsx → client/src/pages/psychology/evaluations/Detail.tsx
# Copy DailyHub.tsx → client/src/pages/psychology/DailyHub.tsx
# Copy Business.tsx → client/src/pages/psychology/Business.tsx

# 3. Update imports in all files to use the new paths:
# OLD: import { Component } from "@/components/Component"
# NEW: import { Component } from "@/components/Component" (stays the same!)

# 4. Create the main psychology routing:

# =============================================================================
# 📝 ROUTING INTEGRATION
# =============================================================================

# client/src/modules/psychology/routes.tsx
export const psychologyRoutes = [
  {
    path: "/psychology",
    component: () => import("@/pages/psychology/DailyHub"),
    name: "Daily Hub"
  },
  {
    path: "/psychology/evaluations",
    component: () => import("@/pages/psychology/evaluations/List"),
    name: "Evaluations List"
  },
  {
    path: "/psychology/evaluations/new", 
    component: () => import("@/pages/psychology/evaluations/New"),
    name: "New Evaluation"
  },
  {
    path: "/psychology/evaluations/:id",
    component: () => import("@/pages/psychology/evaluations/Detail"),
    name: "Evaluation Detail"
  },
  {
    path: "/psychology/evaluations/report-writer",
    component: () => import("@/pages/psychology/evaluations/ReportWriter"),
    name: "Report Writer"
  },
  {
    path: "/psychology/business",
    component: () => import("@/pages/psychology/Business"),
    name: "Business Operations"
  }
];
